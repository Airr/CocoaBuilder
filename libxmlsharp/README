 libxml#
 --------

This is an attempt at a miniature DOM parser based on libxml2.
The parser engine is hooked up directly into C# natively. The
C# code is linked through a native wrapper and DSO interface.

The parser is functional and not does not implement validation.
Further work will proceed in time to make it better as well
as thread safe with Portable.Net runtime.

The development has been concentrated as a sister effort to the
DotGNU Portable.Net project. This project will eventually join
the DotGNU and the GNU movements once the DotGNU SC approves it.

The other hurdle is the (C) assignment to the projects . In view
of applying for inclusion in GNU project, all developers are asked 
to be willing to assign copyright to FSF. But until then it remains
under author copyright.
